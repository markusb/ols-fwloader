This is commandline utility for Diolan bootloader.

OLS - Logic analyzer (http://dangerousprototypes.com/docs/Open_Bench_Logic_Sniffer)

OLS uses modified bootloader. The original fw_update tool does make life harder.
I have therefore created this tool. Simple, yet effective.

License is yet to be added. For now assume GPLv3 license.

There is some usage information / documentation in the dangerousprototypes wiki:
http://dangerousprototypes.com/docs/Logic_Sniffer:_Comprehensive_update_application

To compile you need the libusb-1.0-0-dev package. (This is not the same as libusb-dev !)

Furure plan includes integration with ols-loader.
